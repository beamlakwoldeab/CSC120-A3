Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I consulted my friend Michelle Lawson from outside the class.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I did not make use of any TA hours or office hours for this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
It seems like there is a lot of new vocabulary to learn and syntax to wrap one's head around. Functionality wise, Java seems more powerful for building programs with real world significance.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
It seems to me like the two programming languages are like two similar human languages with  different syntax. I am understanding that programming languages interact with the computer in the same way but humans design them to best suit their needs when interacting with the computer.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
The thing that worked was searching the internet for tips. I was able to see that there are vast amounts of resources out there, and I am getting better at interpreting them and being able to use them. The mistake that I made this time around was probably not going to TA hours or office hours early on to get an idea of how to approach the problem.
